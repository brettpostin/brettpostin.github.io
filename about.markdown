Hello and welcome to my personal blog!

My name is Brett Postin and I am a Principal Architect. I have been working in the software industry since 2006, and during that time, I have gained a wealth of experience in designing and implementing solutions for a variety of problem domains. 

My main areas of expertise are in application architecture, cloud architecture, domain driven design, Azure/.NET development and frontend development. 

On this blog, I share thoughts and insights on issues I encounter, along with solutions and the lessons I learned from them. 

I typically blog about things that, at the time of writing, have little to no coverage and could use another voice. I hope that by sharing my experiences, it will save others time and effort if they encounter the same challenges.

If you have any questions or comments about anything you read on my blog, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for visiting my blog, and I hope you find it informative and helpful!
